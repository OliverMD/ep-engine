/* A class which subclasses the real EPEngine. Its main purpose is to allow
 * us to construct and setup an EPStore without starting all the various
 * background tasks which are normally started by EPEngine as part of creating
 * EPStore (in the initialize() method).
 *
 * The net result is a (mostly) synchronous environment - while the
 * ExecutorPool's threads exist, none of the normally-created background Tasks
 * should be running. Note however that /if/ any new tasks are created, they
 * will be scheduled on the ExecutorPools' threads asynchronously.
